Part 1 (Running programs with forked processes):

#2: There was a segmentation fault when I tried to run the program likely because
there was no argument passed for a time to sleep
#4:
-3000 microseconds: The parent process started first and it finished last
-500: Same results as 3000 but the program ran much faster. This is due to the fact that
it had to sleep for less time.
-5000: Same results as the test with 3000 but it took longer to finish running.

Part 2 (Running programs with threading):

#5: Overall, the programs ran faster with threading than with forked processes.

-3000 microseconds: The parent process started first and it finished last
-500: Same results as 3000 but the program ran much faster. This is due to the fact that
it had to sleep for less time.
-5000: Same results as the test with 3000 but it took longer to finish running.
