Part 1:
netstat - it prints a large number of TCP connections (TCP4 and TCP6) all with varying
local and foreign (end host) addresses indicating that they are all being
used by different applications to transmit data to varying locations.

ifconfig - prints all of the active interfaces (sockets, ports, etc..) on the current system

hostname- prints the name of the current host; in my case it was the name of my computer.

ping- sends a series of data packets to some specified host (IP) to determine
connectivity status and RTT. It gives a list of how many data packets sent and the time
taken to return

traceroute - prints out the name & address of each hop on the route to the destination
and the size of each packet. It also prints connection times to reach each node.
This is useful to test the end-to-end connection times for different hosts, which the
command also provides.

telnet- establishes a connection from the local host to some end host.
since we are connected to a another server, we can choose which port to send data over.
For example connecting to port 80 will allow me to send GET/POST/etc.. messages
via HTTP.

host/dig - Running the host command gives a list of the name servers listed for a
particular website along with its IP addresses

route - allows the user to make changes to the system's routing tables used by the software to determine
 what port to send data packets through. It can manipulate routes to different destinations.

arp - prints a list of all IP addresses for devices connected to the router and their corresponding
MAC addresses


Part 2:
$ping -s 32 109.239.56.146
-Sending 32 bytes per packet to a server in Strasbourg, France was successful with a 190.635ms
average and a 0.0% packet loss.
-1048 bytes, 224.742 ms and 0.0% packet loss

 $ping -s 32 142.250.72.206
 -Sending 32 bytes per packet to Google's server in Mountain View was successful
with a 21.970ms average and a 0.0% packet loss.
-1048 bytes, 24.716 ms and 0.0% packet loss

$ping -s 32 14.102.127.255
-Sending 32 bytes per packet to a server in Delhi,India was successful
with a 307.810ms average and a 5.9% packet loss.
-1048 bytes, 372.923 ms and 7.7% packet loss

-Given that Delhi is the furthest geographical location from me in Santa Clara,
it makes sense that it would take the longest time to return data from there.

Part 4:
Calling telnet on gaia.cs.umass.edu returns an HTML file.
The title of the file is "Interactive Problems, Computer Networking: A Top Down
 Approach" which is in HTTP 1.1
 The file is separated by headers which represent chapters and each chapter has
 lists of links to different practice problems.

 Part 5:
 Connecting to 109.239.56.146 over port 80 connected successfully. connecting over port 3389 was refused
 and I was unable to establish a connection. The same was true for connecting to
 142.250.72.206 and also for 14.102.127.255. I am unsure what caused this since I
 ran the command multiple times and it was not able to connect successfully.
